Education Teaching and Research
=============

I have been working at Iowa State University as a staff member in the Aerospace Engineering Department since 2006.  During that time I have done a lot of teaching and mentoring of students.  After obtaining my Masters of Science in Computer Engineering in 2016, I decided to pursue a PhD in Human Computer Interaction with an emphasis in Engineering Education.  

This page will serve to show some of the teaching I have done.  I plan to post some of my past and current lectures or courses that I have taught over the years and hopefully in the many years to come.  In addition, I plan to post some thoughts or other items pertaining my research in engineering education.  Specifically in the area of student professional development skills such as leadership skills within a hands on learning environment.  This ties in to my current job at the University, which is the Program Coordinator for the Make to Innovate program there.  The Make to Innovate program allows all students (though mostly engineering students) to work on hands on projects and learn from these experiences.
