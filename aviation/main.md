Aviation
=============

Working in the Aerospace Engineering department you get to be around planes...a lot.  We have airplane wings, engines, propellers and even the space shuttle elevon hanging on our walls.  So it was probably inevitable that I would actually want to fly someday.  Back in 2014 I thought it was finally time.  So I asked my wife if it would be ok to take flying lessons.  Her response kind of surprised me.  Her response was "only if I can too."  So, we both started taking flying lessons and you know what?  She beat me to it by about 3 months.  Now we both have our PPL, we have started working on our instrument rating and we have already had some fun flying adventures.  

This page will link to some other pages that are related to aviation.  There are some projects that I have worked on with this and of course I plan to have more pictures/videos and updates.  So stay tuned.
