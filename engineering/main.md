Projects
=============

As an Electrical and Computer Engineer I enjoy working on a number of projects.  Some of these are small and don't take much time.  Others are fairly large and often span months if not years.  Some projects remain in limbo due to various reasons (usually time).  In any case, this the place that I will talk about engineering and probably most of my projects.
