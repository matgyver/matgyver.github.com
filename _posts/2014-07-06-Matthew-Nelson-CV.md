Additional Research Experience
==============================
Thesis Topic - Application of remote sensing radiometer with software defined radios.  My thesis area focused on using software defined radios (SDR), along with GNURadio to create a flexible tool that can be used for remote sensing using a L-band radiometer.  My focus was rebuilding the digital side of an existing L-band radiometer with more modern equipment and designing a flexible and more user friendly interface to this equipment.

Soil Moisture measurement using an L-band radiometer, Hornbuckle Research Group, Iowa State University (Dr. Brian Hornbuckle, PI).  Project Manager and Chief Engineer.  Worked on the maintenance and also in updating the ISU L-band radiometer for soil moisture research.  2005-2011.

Study of wheat rust propagation using latex weather balloons, Space Systems and Controls Lab, Iowa State University (Dr. Forrest Nutter, PI).  Project Manager and Chief Engineer for the project.  Designed electronics used for visible, Near Infrared (NIR) photography, and a spore trap collection system using the Rotorod samplers.  Designed the payloads carried under the latex weather balloons.  Oversaw operation procedures for deployment and collection of data in the field.  2007 - 2009
