Education Teaching and Research
=============

I have been working at Iowa State University as a staff member in the Aerospace Engineering Department since 2006.  During that time I have done a lot of teaching and mentoring of students.  After obtaining my Masters of Science in Computer Engineering in 2016, I decided to pursue a PhD in Human Computer Interaction with an emphasis in Engineering Education.  

This page will serve to show some of the teaching I have done.  I plan to post some of my past and current lectures or courses that I have taught over the years and hopefully in the many years to come.  In addition, I plan to post some thoughts or other items pertaining my research in engineering education.  Specifically in the area of student professional development skills such as leadership skills within a hands on learning environment.  This ties in to my current job at the University, which is the Program Coordinator for the Make to Innovate program there.  The Make to Innovate program allows all students (though mostly engineering students) to work on hands on projects and learn from these experiences.  

Make to Innovate
===============

Make to Innovate is a program that was started by Dr. Richard Wlezien in 2011.  At the time, there were some hands on projects in the department (Spacecraft Systems and Controls Lab and Open Lab).  However, neither had adequate funding or organization.  It was decieded to take some of the existing projects and place them in a new program called Make to Innovate (M:2:I).  The program began with about 50 students and about 7 projects.  It has now grown to over 200 students and 13 projects.  

Introduction to Aerospace Engineering (AerE 160)
================

In 2011 the AerE 160 course was revamped by Dr. Richard Wlezien (Department Chair).  Part of the changes made to this class was with the lab component.  An emphasis was made for a more hands on approach to the labs.  One item that I have been involved in is the Lighter Than Air (LTA) competition that is held at the end of the semester.  For nearly half of the semester, students design, build and fly a lighter than air vehicle that must perform certain tasks and/or navigate an obsticle course.  In recent years we have increased the complexity of the competition by adding additional hardware that is integrated on the vehicle, obsticle course or both.
