History
============================
One of the first web pages and domains that we owned was called Stealthpegasus.com.  Stealthpegasus was run our own Linux web server and was for the most part our humble little web server in our corner of the internet.  As time went on, we got an odd letter through the mail.  It was from a scum bag lawyer that claimed that they owned "stealth".  Yep, one of those guys.  Basically we got a cease or deceit letter claiming we owed them money for using the word.  As it turns out, the registration was about to run out, and while we did not feel there was any validity to their claim (and later found out there wasn't), we decided to just let the name drop.

Later, my wife and I started up RFGeeks.com.  It also started out as a website that my wife and I ran from our own Linux based server we put together.  RFGeeks went through a lot of changes, from our own server, to eventually purchasing server space.  We kept that running for a number of years as it went from hosting a phpBB forum, chat server and other services.  However, over time we stopped using those services, and eventually we dropped our service provider.  It was often though, and still is, a reflection of our interests and things that we enjoyed doing.  RFGeeks then went into hiatus and we then brought it back as a Github page which is where it is hosted now.

RFGeeks always was and still us our little corner of the internet.  Both my wife and I try to update things from time to time and have been using this to show our interests, travels, and projects.  We hope enjoy our little website.  Who knows where this domain will end up next, but for now, this is home.
