Education Teaching and Research
=============

I have been working at Iowa State University as a staff member in the Aerospace Engineering Department since 2006.  During that time I have done a lot of teaching and mentoring of students.  After obtaining my Masters of Science in Computer Engineering in 2016, I decided to pursue a PhD in Human Computer Interaction with an emphasis in Engineering Education.  

This page will serve to show some of the teaching I have done and research that I have done.  I plan to post some of my past and current lectures or courses that I have taught over the years and hopefully in the many years to come.  In addition, I plan to post some thoughts or other items pertaining my research in engineering education.  Specifically in the area of student professional development skills such as leadership skills within a hands on learning environment.  This ties in to my current job at the University, which is the Program Coordinator for the Make to Innovate program there.  The Make to Innovate program allows all students (though mostly engineering students) to work on hands on projects and learn from these experiences.  

PhD research
=============
In 2016 I decided to continue my education by pursuing a PhD in Human Computer Interaction with research in Engineering Education.  I currently work with Dr. Benjamin Ahn and his research group at the engineering education studio at Iowa State University.  My research focuses on using virtual reality to teach engineering students professional development skills.  Specifically we are wanting to teach students professional development skills such as leadership, teamwork, communication and ethics.  Our framework for this research is using Game Based Learning (GBL), which is based on project and problem based learning.  With GBL, we use a gaming environment to setup and present the students with a problem.  We then let them explore solutions in the gaming environment.  By using virtual reality students can now enter a more interactive world and it allows us to bring situations or scenarios that would be impractical or impossible in the real world.  

Make to Innovate
===============

Make to Innovate is a program that was started back in 2011.  It is a course that uses a Project Based Learning (PBL) framework in teaching students real world engineering skills, professional development skills, and other skills that they may not normally pick in their field of study.  It is designed to allow students to work in teams to develop professional development skills and to work on real world problems through problem solving.  The course can be considered a "flipped" classroom in which there is no set lecture and the students are allowed to develop solutions on their own.  At the time, there were some hands on projects in the department (Spacecraft Systems and Controls Lab and Open Lab).  However, neither had adequate funding or organization.  It was decided to take some of the existing projects and place them in a new program called Make to Innovate (M:2:I).  The program began with about 50 students and about 7 projects.

Today Make to Innovate has grown to over 270 students across 16 projects.  The program has students from Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Ag Engineering and many others.  In addition, the program also has students from Meteorology, Business, Biology and others.   

Projects in Make to Innovate vary from Sailboats, Rovers, drones, high altitude balloons and cubesats.  Students also have a chance to work with industry experts from companies like Boeing, Rockwell Collins, NASA, and other companies.  Additional information about Make to Innovate can be found on our website at https://m2i.aere.iastate.edu

Introduction to Aerospace Engineering (AerE 160)
================

In 2011 the AerE 160 course was revamped by Dr. Richard Wlezien (Department Chair).  Part of the changes made to this class was with the lab component.  An emphasis was made for a more hands on approach to the labs.  One item that I have been involved in is the Lighter Than Air (LTA) competition that is held at the end of the semester.  For nearly half of the semester, students design, build and fly a lighter than air vehicle that must perform certain tasks and/or navigate an obsticle course.  In recent years we have increased the complexity of the competition by adding additional hardware that is integrated on the vehicle, obsticle course or both.
