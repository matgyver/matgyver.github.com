Aviation
=============

Working in the Aerospace Engineering department you get to be around planes...a lot.  We have airplane wings, engines, propellers and even the space shuttle elevon hanging on our walls.  So it was probably inevitable that I would actually want to fly someday.  Back in 2014 I thought it was finally time.  So I asked my wife if it would be ok to take flying lessons.  Her response kind of surprised me.  Her response was "only if I can too."  So, we both started taking flying lessons and you know what?  She beat me to it by about 3 months.  Now we both have our PPL, we have started working on our instrument rating and we have already had some fun flying adventures.  

This page will link to some other pages that are related to aviation.  There are some projects that I have worked on with this and of course I plan to have more pictures/videos and updates.  So stay tuned.

StratuX
-----
The StratuX allows for a person to build their own ADS-B IN receiver.  Using a Raspberry Pi, some Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and a version of Linux to run it all and you have a portable receiver that can provide you with aircraft and weather information.

It is very easy to build one of these units.  But of course I wanted to take it a step further and add additional features to the unit.  Speificially I looked at an internal battery system, an OLED display to display additional information and a Carbon Monoxide sensor.  You can view my work with this on this page: [StratuX Project](/aviation/stratux/stratux.md)

I also did a WINGS course talking about ADS-B, the importance of ADS-B and also building a StratuX unit.  You can see my PowerPoint presentation for this here: [ADS-B Presentation April 2016](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvCbHdocSd5Jl20Pn4AjiUSgs5ch)
