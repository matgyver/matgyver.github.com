## Introduction
Written word has been a major cornerstone of civilization for aeons and it continues to be a major player in just about everything that we do.  It is one of the first skills we learn as a child and a written document proclaims both our death and our final wishes.  Without it, civilization as we know it would not exist.  

Writing and reading text has been fundamental for humans and even though there are various languages, the method of writing and printing on paper has stayed pretty much the same.  However we now live in a digital age and more and more of our information is being created and transferred into this digital medium.  Our thoughts, wishes and desires now exist as ones and zeros on computers and moves quickly from one to to the other through the internet.  

This of course is a good thing.  The Internet has allowed for knowledge to flow to more places and much quicker than previously thought possible.  But there has been some bumps, and there continues to be some bumps as this medium is constantly evolving.  But there is of course a growing concern, and one that while the printed medium has seen, could be even a greater problem in our digital age.

## The problem with Word
The problem with Word and really most word processing programs is that they tend to over complicate things.  The first and your primary goal of writing anything down is to communicate your point across.  This typically means that people need to be able to read your information.  The simplest method is by simply putting text into a computer and for many years this was the only method.  However, eventually people want to format their text, in many cases in an attempt to make the text easier to read or to follow.  While simple text is usually fairly easy to read and follow, there are times where you need to better communicate a particular point.  This may be done by using a emphasis, italics, underline or bold and in some cases a combination of those.  People also wanted to insert things such as images, charts and other diagrams to again further their point and communicate their intent.  Thus was born the word processor.

At first glance a word processing program such as Word seems like a good thing.  You can write text, insert images, charts and diagrams, and format the text as needed.  But there are some issues that we need to address with these programs that either over complicate things, creates undesirable results or distracts from what you are trying to do.

### Formatting
The word processor was brought about to help those better format their information.  Unfortunately, most word processing programs utterly fail at the task that they were developed to do.  It's not entirely it's fault, the word processor has evolved to a tool that can be used by the masses.  It was designed with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that attempts to make it easy for the user to find the format they want and implement it.  But somewhere down the line things became too complicated and even simple tasks seems like a chore with a word processor.  

In addition, there are many times where the program simply does not format in the way you want.  Or, in other cases you get it formatted in the way you want, then go and add one line of text and now everything is not in it's proper place.  This usually results in tweaking things, moving things around, again, and maybe you just delete that line of text you added so it can go back to the way it was.  Of course when you do that, it doesn't return to the way it was so now not only did you loose the information you wanted to add, but you are once again back to formatting, moving things around and otherwise fighting the program instead of it helping you.  

This of course doesn't always happen, but it is frustrating when it does.  Even when things do go right, you are often looking for menus, finding that button you need to push to get the correct formatting.  This leads to our next issue with programs like these, and that is distraction.

### Preserving our information
Another issue with most programs like Word is that the format that the data is saved in is proprietary.  Microsoft designed it so that only Microsoft Word can open Microsoft Word documents.  You really can't blame Microsoft for this, after all they are a for-profit company so their goal is to make money, not necessarily preserve the written human knowledge of the world.  In recent years though this has started to change.  Other programs such Libre Office is able to open and write to Microsoft Word.  Technically Microsoft Word now uses the Open Document Standard so that other programs can read and write to it.  However there are problems with this.  The formatting does not always stay the same and this can often lead to documents that look different then what the author originally intended it to look like.  In addition, these are still binary formats.  If for some reason Microsoft went away and as time marches on programs change, there is a chance the files may not be readable any more.  This of course could happen for any computer program or file format, but file formats that use a proprietary system are more prone to go extinct.

### Distraction from writing
In many cases, you simply want to write.  You are trying to communicate something and contribute to the vast knowledge of the human race and you really don't want to mess with all of the nitty gritty details to make it look nice.  On the other hand, you want your document to be readable and for those reading it to enjoy reading it.  This is often the issue many writers face, they put up with programs like Word because they want their work to be readable, but they also hate programs like this since it distracts from the actually writing they are trying to accomplish.  But, there are options, and it is these options we are going to explore now.

## Text only
In recent years, there has been a growing trend to go back to a simpler method for writing.  These are usually text only formats in which you only use ASCII text characters.  You might think thought this results in very plain documents, but the truth is that thanks to programs like LaTeX and Markdown you can still create well formatted documents while the main information is still preserved in standard ASCII format.  

### A note about ASCII
ASCII has been around pretty much since the dawn of computers.  For many years and before there was any word processors out there, information was transferred using ASCII text.  It is still used today and is considered to be a standard that virtually all computers use and even other devices such as cell phones, tablets and even embedded devices can read.  Therefore it can be fairly safely assumed that ASCII will be around for a long time and it is probably the most universal format used in virtually all computing platforms

### Pros and Cons
Like everything there are certainly pros and cons to using this method for writing.  We will take a look at some of those now.

Pros
+ Information is stored in ASCII format which can be ready by almost any device or computer
+ Generally it's free to use and write with
+ You have greater control on how things are formatted
+ Generally uses very little resources

Cons
+ Generally there is no WYSIWYG, you need to compile your file to see the formatting
+ It can be steeper learning curve, in some ways like learning to program
+ 

### Markdown
One method for writing text and still have the ability to format your work is to use Markdown.  In fact this blog post is currently written in Markdown.  Markdown allows you write text but add formatting commands to it.  In this blogs case, I am using GitHub and their Pages feature to create a blog.  I upload my file to GitHub, then allow their Jekyll service to render the pages.  Jekyll is able to read and understand Markdown and so it recognizes the formatting commands in this blog and formats them accordingly.  If you wish, you can download a copy of this file and read it any text program.  For this blog I am using Notepad++ but there are others which we will cover later.  

This allows me to focus on the writing of this blog.  I can insert the formatting commands at any time, either while writing or afterwards.  

### LaTeX
