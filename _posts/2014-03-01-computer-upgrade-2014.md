Every now and again I look at my computer and think, it's time for an upgrade.  This is something that I have done for quite a while now.  I built my first computer when I was 18, a 486 DX2 running at 80 MHz.  Since then I have built, rebuilt and upgraded my computers.  In some cases I simply upgrade one or two components, usually to extend the life of my current build.  Other times, like this time, I completely rebuilt the computer, usually replacing motherboard, CPU, RAM, and video card.

Previous Build
==============

My last full build took place in February of 2008.  This build had the following specs:

+ MSI K9A2 AMD motherboard
+ AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ CPU
+ GeForce 8800 512 MB
+ 4 GB RAM
+ Seasonic 550W PSU
+ 250GB HDD

In March 2010 I then upgraded this build with the following specs:

+ 4GB RAM -> 8GB RAM
+ GeForce 8800 -> Radeon HD5700
+ AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ -> AMD Phenom X4 940 Black edition at 3 GHz

In 2013 my wife surprised me with a new case, a Phantom NZXT case.  She also upgraded the HDD to a 128 GB SSD and I had already upgraded to a 750GB drive earlier.  

The new build
=============

The new build upgraded the following components

+ MSI K9A2 -> Asus Z87-A (NFC Edition)
+ AMD Phenom X4 950 -> Intel i5 4670K @ 3.2 GHz
+ 8GB RAM -> 8GB RAM (faster of course DDR3 1866)
+ Radeon HD5700 -> MSI GTX770
+ Seasonic 550W PSU -> Corsair 850W
+ Added liquid cooling system, Corsair H80i

As you can see, there were some significant changes in hardware and some jumps made.  Specifically the jump from AMD to Intel and the jump from AMD/Radeon to NVidia.  Finally the addition of a water cooling system was another big jump.  I'll talk about all of these next.  

The case
--------

The computer case in this build is not technically new.  My wife surprised me when I got back from a business trip.  She did not like the case I had, and for good reason.  It was old, the fans were noisy, and it was fairly dated.  So she bought me a new case, new case fans and also bought me a new SSD Hard Drive.  I love the case and it had more room and better cable management for building PCs.  So this gave me a great start on this build.

PSU
---

The PSU was upgraded from a Seasonic 550 W unit to a Corsair 850 W unit.  The other major change was moving to a modular PSU which helps a lot in reducing the clutter in the case.  

Switch to Intel
---------------

I had been running AMD processors for nearly 10 years.  They gave me great performance and reliability and usually a lower price point.  But things have changed.  AMD has lost some ground in recent years and while they still produce excellent processors, the performance is not as good.  It used to be that AMD at times, was ahead of Intel, but recently they seem to be playing more catchup than leading the way.  So I made the decision to switch to Intel for my processor.  As far as using an i5 vs an i7, in desktop computers the performance boost isn't that great between the two, but the cost is.  Another strategy I often do in my builds is getting components that can be upgraded in the foreseeable future.  So as prices go down, I can always upgrade to an i7 later if needed.

Adding liquid cooling
---------------------

Liquid cooling is nothing new in building PCs, builders have been experimenting with liquid cooling systems for years.  As I mentioned, my case even has some ports in the back to allow for water cooling hoses to run in and out of the case.  At first, I started looking into that option.  However, recently there have been more factory built and sealed liquid cooling options.  These options come sealed from the factory and has all the parts you need.  The Corsair H80i which I selected comes pre-sealed, but also includes a USB interface on the pump assembly.  This means that you can now monitor the pumps RPM and temperature of the coolant.  It also includes a RGB LED on the housing that you can either set to a certain color, cycle colors, or have the color set by the temperature, which is a handy visual aid.  

Liquid cooling has a number of advantages.  The two big advantages though is very quiet operation and very efficient operation.  Liquid cooling can often cool much faster and more effectively then most standard air coolers.  This allows for things like over-clocking
