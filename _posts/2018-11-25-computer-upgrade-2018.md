Since college I have had my computer that I have named Auron (after the Final Fantasy X character).  Auron has gone through a number of revisions as you can see below.  To date Auron has gone through 4 major revisions and several smaller revisions.  For me, a major revision is usually gutting most of the components and replacing them.  This is usually motherboard, CPU, RAM and possibly video card.  Smaller revisions are usually just one of those components or upgrading/adding a hard drive or other drive system.  The revision that I did just now is a major revision five, so this is Auron 5.0.  Previously I would say Auron was at revision 4.2 as I did upgrade the video card and upgraded the memory and HDD before that.  Here is the history as I remember it:

Pre-Auron
=========
486-DX2 @ 80 MHz circa 1992
Pentium @ 200 MHz circa 1995
Pentium II @ 266 MHz circa 1999

My first computer was when I was a senior in High School.  From there the dates are fairly good guesses.  Between 1995-1997 I also ran my own company that built PCs, so I'm sure I swapped hardware a lot then as I had really good access to up to date hardware.  Keep in mind these dates are estimates and this was over 20 years ago.

Auron
=====

In 2001 FF-X came out and it was probably around this time that I started naming my computer Auron.  It was also around this time that I switched from Intel to AMD.  I don't remember having a PIII or IV so I'm pretty sure this is when I switched to an AMD Athlon.

Auron 1.0
---------
AMD Athlon @ 700 MHz (???) circa probably 2001/2002

Auron 2.0
---------
Athlon XP @ 1 GHz circa probably 2005

After this I do have better records of what I upgraded, so the below is fairly accurate.

Auron 3.0 (2008)
---------
My last full build took place in February of 2008.  This build had the following specs:

+ MSI K9A2 AMD motherboard
+ AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ CPU
+ GeForce 8800 512 MB
+ 4 GB RAM
+ Seasonic 550W PSU
+ 250GB HDD

Auron 3.1 (2010)
---------
In March 2010 I then upgraded this build with the following specs:

+ 4GB RAM -> 8GB RAM
+ GeForce 8800 -> Radeon HD5700
+ AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ -> AMD Phenom X4 940 Black edition at 3 GHz

Auron 3.2 (2013)
---------
In 2013 my wife surprised me with a new case, a Phantom NZXT case.  She also upgraded the HDD to a 128 GB SSD and I had already upgraded to a 750GB drive earlier.  
Auron 4.0 (2014)
----------------
The new build upgraded the following components

+ MSI K9A2 -> Asus Z87-A (NFC Edition)
+ AMD Phenom X4 950 -> Intel i5 4670K @ 3.2 GHz
+ 8GB RAM -> 8GB RAM (faster of course DDR3 1866)
+ Radeon HD5700 -> MSI GTX770
+ Seasonic 550W PSU -> Corsair 850W
+ Added liquid cooling system, Corsair H80i

As you can see, there were some significant changes in hardware and some jumps made.  Specifically the jump from AMD to Intel and the jump from AMD/Radeon to NVidia.  Finally the addition of a water cooling system was another big jump.  I'll talk about all of these next.  

Auron 4.1 (2016)
----------------
Upgraded memory to 16 GB, added 500 GB SSD drive

Auron 4.2 (2017)
----------------
Upgraded Nvidia 1080

Auron 5.0
=========

Auron 5.0 brings me back to AMD.  The main reason I switched to Intel was at the time Intel and AMD were really close in both price and performance.  However, there was some better compatibility between NVidia and Intel (which is no longer the case).  So I switched to Intel.  I was really happy with the Intel build, it worked just fine and gave me 4 good years of very little issues.  The computer was usually on 24/7 and I never had a failure.

The reason for the switch back to AMD was due to the fact that AMD was once again winning the battle with performance per price.  In addition, the boost in the number of cores and threads was something I was looking for.  While this is a gaming PC, it is also my daily driver for programming (so compiling) and my research currently uses Unity and developing games.  Also, form time to time I need to crunch through a lot of data, so having the extra horsepower and knowing that I can use all of the cores helped to seal the deal.  

+ Asus Z87-A -> Asus ROG Strix X470-F AMD Ryzen 2 AM4 motherboard
+ Intel i5 4670K @ 3.2 GHz -> AMD Ryzen 7 2700X @ 4 GHz (8 cores, 16 threads)
+ 16GB DDR3 memory -> 32 GB G.SKILL DDR4 3200 MHz
+ Corsair H80i AIO cooler -> NZXT X52 AIO Cooler
+ Added Samsung 970 EVO 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD drive

Power supply and case were left the same.  The old components will be going into a new server that my wife and I are building.  This new server is mostly a NAS box so processing power is not critical.  So we kept most of the key components together.

The current drive storage I had was a 500GB SSD drive as my primary drive and a 1TB mechanical drive that was used for game storage and other large files.  The 1TB drive however was pretty much full.  So I have begun moving programs over to the 970 and will use the 500GB SSD for games.  The 1TB will be used for other data storage (games, media, etc) as needed.  

Build Process
=============
Coming soon.

Install
--------

The computer case in this build is not technically new.  My wife surprised me when I got back from a business trip.  She did not like the case I had, and for good reason.  It was old, the fans were noisy, and it was fairly dated.  So she bought me a new case, new case fans and also bought me a new SSD Hard Drive.  I love the case and it had more room and better cable management for building PCs.  So this gave me a great start on this build.
